**Overview**. We'd like to use the continuous-time Markov Model of Atrial fibrillation we developed in 
[homework assignment 5](https://yale.instructure.com/courses/43583/assignments/92545) to evaluate 
the performance of anticoagulation using cost-utility and cost-benefit methods.

**Problem 1: Discounted Cost and Utility (Weight 1)**. Report the average discounted cost and QALY of 
patients who start in start "Well" under both scenarios of with and without anticoagulation: 
- Use the discount rate 3%.
- Assume that the utility of being in state “Well” is 1, 
in state “Stroke” is 0.2, and in state “Post-Stroke” is 0.9.
- The annual cost of being in “Post-Stroke” is $200 and when anticoagulation is used, this cost increases to $750.
- Stoke results in a one-time cost of $5,000. 

**Problem 2: Change in Outcomes (Weight 1)**. 
Estimate the change in the expected discounted cost, the expected discounted utility, 
and the expected number of strokes when the anticoagulation drug is used. 
Report the 95% confidence intervals for all your estimates.  

**Problem 3: Cost-Utility Analysis (Weight 1)**. Use a cost-utility plane to display 
the expected discounted incremental utility and cost form the anticoagulation drug. 
Report the results of your cost-utility analysis in a table. 
Make sure to include the 95% confidence intervals for all reported estimates 
(discounted cost, discounted utility, incremental discounted cost, 
incremental discounted utility and the ICER).   

**Problem 4: Cost-Benefit Analysis (Weight 1)**. 
Plot the incremental net monetary benefit curve when the anticoagulation drugs 
is used for varying values of willingness-to-pay. 
Show the 95% confidence region. 
At what level of willingness-to-pay would you recommend adopting this 
anticoagulation drug?
